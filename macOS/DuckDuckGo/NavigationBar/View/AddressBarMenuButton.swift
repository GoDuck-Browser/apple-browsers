/// A specialized button class for forwarding mouse events in `AddressBarViewController`.

/// `AddressBarMenuButton` extends `AddressBarButton` to handle forwarding mouse events, especially the right mouse button down event which are used to trigger the NSMenu.
/// This makes sure `AddressBarViewController` processes these events correctly in `func rightMouseDown(with event: NSEvent) -> NSEvent?`.
